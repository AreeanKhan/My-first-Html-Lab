            My favorite game is Jedi Fallen Order. It is a game based on Star Wars. It is created by Respwan Entertainment and EA. The game is about this young Jedi's journey to rebuild the Jedi Order with his friends: the crew of the Mantis. In the game, you play as the young Jedi (Cal Kestis) and journey across the galaxy on the Mantis. You solve puzzles and inhace your lightsaber and Force abilities. All while be chased and traced down by the Empire and the Inquisition. </p>
