            My favorite game is Jedi Fallen Order. It is a game by Respawn Entertainment and EA. It is a game based around the Star Wars story line. It is based after the great purge of the Jedi Order. Therefore, 5 years after the rise of the formitable Darth Vader. It is about a padawan learner, who's master died during the purge. This padawan's name is Cal Kestis. You probably never heard of him because he was never mentioned in the Star Wars main movies series. Anyways, he was found by the Empire and ran away. He was found by these two people who wanted to rebuild the Jedi order. To do this, they had to follow a series of puzzles and paths to find a open the Vault. Inside the Vault was a holocron containing a list of force sensitives, that could be future Jedi padwans: their master would be Cal Kestis. He needs to solve all this puzzles across the galaxy with the Inquisitors chasing him. The Inquisitors are dark force-sensitives, who are under the comand of the Grand Inquisitor: also known as Darth Vader. The two main inquisitors are The Second Sister and The Ninth Sister. Cal is also chased by Purge Troopers who are highly trained and are commited to destroy any Jedi. In this game, you play as Cal. You solve puzzles and imperial soldiers, as well as the Inquisitors and Purge Troopers. You go through the game improving you saber skills and working to rebuild the Jedi Order.    <a href src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Click here to find more about the game.</a>
